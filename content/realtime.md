# Realtime Monitoring and OpenKasm

---

### We want to

* *Measure behavior taking place on a social network*
* Simulate/predict/model future behavior on the network

---

OSoMe is useful for ad-hoc **historical** analysis.

What about ongoing analysis?

---

## OpenKasm

---

The user defines one or more *campaigns*.

A campaign is a collection of words, phrases, and/or hashtags one wants to
monitor.

---

For each campaign, all Tweets are collected, analyzed, and stored.

Example analysis module: sentiment.
